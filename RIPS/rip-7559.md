> **_ATTENTION_**: The RIPs repository is in the startup phase, and so is undergoing many changes. This document is very much a work in progress. Both the process and how RIPs will be written and governed is still being worked on. Feedback encouraged on [Ethereum Magicians](https://ethereum-magicians.org/).

## What is an RIP?

RIP stands for Rollup Improvement Proposal. An RIP is a design document providing information to the greater Ethereum community, or describing a new feature for Ethereum Rollup/L2/EVM ecosystem. The RIP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature. 

## RIP Header Preamble

Each RIP must begin with an [RFC 822](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc822.txt) style header preamble, preceded and followed by three hyphens (`---`). This header is also termed ["front matter" by Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/). The headers must appear in the following order.

`rip`: *RIP number*

`title`: *The RIP title is a few words, not a complete sentence*

`description`: *Description is one full (short) sentence*

`author`: *The list of the author's or authors' name(s) and/or username(s), or name(s) and email(s). Details are below.*

`discussions-to`: *The url pointing to the official discussion thread*

`status`: TDB

`type`: *One of `Standards Track`, `Meta`, or `Informational`*

`category`: *One of `Core`, `Networking`, `Interface`

`created`: *Date the RIP was created on*

`requires`: *RIP number(s)* (Optional field)

`withdrawal-reason`: *A sentence explaining why the RIP was withdrawn.* (Optional field, only needed when status is `Withdrawn`)

Headers that permit lists must separate elements with commas.

Headers requiring dates will always do so in the format of ISO 8601 (yyyy-mm-dd).

### `author` header

The `author` header lists the names, email addresses or usernames of the authors/owners of the RIP. Those who prefer anonymity may use a username only, or a first name and a username. The format of the `author` header value must be:

> Random J. User &lt;address@dom.ain&gt;

or

> Random J. User (@username)

or

> Random J. User (@username) &lt;address@dom.ain&gt;

if the email address and/or GitHub username is included, and

> Random J. User

if neither the email address nor the GitHub username are given.

At least one author must use a GitHub username, in order to get notified on change requests and have the capability to approve or reject them.

### `discussions-to` header

While an RIP is a draft, a `discussions-to` header will indicate the URL where the RIP is being discussed.

The preferred discussion URL is a topic on [Ethereum Magicians](https://ethereum-magicians.org/). The URL cannot point to Github pull requests, any URL which is ephemeral, and any URL which can get locked over time (i.e. Reddit topics).

### `type` header

The `type` header specifies the type of RIP: Standards Track, Meta, or Informational. If the track is Standards please include the subcategory (core, networking, interface, or ERC).

### `category` header

The `category` header specifies the RIP's category. This is required for standards-track RIPs only.

### `created` header

The `created` header records the date that the RIP was assigned a number. Both headers should be in yyyy-mm-dd format, e.g. 2001-08-14.

### `requires` header

RIPs may have a `requires` header, indicating the RIP numbers that this RIP depends on. If such a dependency exists, this field is required.

A `requires` dependency is created when the current RIP cannot be understood or implemented without a concept or technical element from another RIP. Merely mentioning another RIP does not necessarily create such a dependency.

## Linking to External Resources

Other than the specific exceptions listed below, links to external resources **SHOULD NOT** be included. External resources may disappear, move, or change unexpectedly.

The process governing permitted external resources is described in [RIP-5757](./rip-5757.md).

Which renders as:

[HTML](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/commit-snapshots/578def68a9735a1e36610a6789245ddfc13d24e0/)

Permitted WHATWG specification URLs must anchor to a specification defined in the `spec` subdomain (idea specifications are not allowed) and to a commit snapshot, and so must match this regular expression:

```regex
^https:\/\/[a-z]*\.spec\.whatwg\.org/commit-snapshots/[0-9a-f]{40}/$
```

Although not recommended by WHATWG, RIPs must anchor to a particular commit so that future readers can refer to the exact version of the living standard that existed at the time the RIP was finalized. This gives readers sufficient information to maintain compatibility, if they so choose, with the version referenced by the RIP and the current living standard.

### Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)

See the [Citation Style Language Schema](https://resource.citationstyles.org/schema/v1.0/input/json/csl-data.json) for the supported fields. In addition to passing validation against that schema, references must include a DOI and at least one URL.

The top-level URL field must resolve to a copy of the referenced document which can be viewed at zero cost. Values under `additional-urls` must also resolve to a copy of the referenced document, but may charge a fee.

## Linking to other RIPs

References to other RIPs should follow the format `RIP-N` where `N` is the RIP number you are referring to.  Each RIP that is referenced in an RIP **MUST** be accompanied by a relative markdown link the first time it is referenced, and **MAY** be accompanied by a link on subsequent references.  The link **MUST** always be done via relative paths so that the links work in this GitHub repository, forks of this repository, the main RIPs site, mirrors of the main RIP site, etc.  For example, you would link to this RIP as `./rip-1.md`.

## Auxiliary Files

Images, diagrams and auxiliary files should be included in a subdirectory of the `assets` folder for that RIP as follows: `assets/rip-N` (where **N** is to be replaced with the RIP number). When linking to an image in the RIP, use relative links such as `../assets/rip-1/image.png`.

## Style Guide

### Titles

The `title` field in the preamble:

- Should not include the word "standard" or any variation thereof; and
- Should not include the RIP's number.

### Descriptions

The `description` field in the preamble:

- Should not include the word "standard" or any variation thereof; and
- Should not include the RIP's number.

### RFC 2119 and RFC 8174

RIPs are encouraged to follow [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.html) and [RFC 8174](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc8174.html) for terminology and to insert the following at the beginning of the Specification section:

> The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.
